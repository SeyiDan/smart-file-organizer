# User Study Protocol: Smart Semantic File Organizer
## Research Paper Evaluation Framework

### Study Overview
**Objective**: Evaluate the effectiveness and user satisfaction of the Smart Semantic File Organizer compared to traditional file organization methods.

**Research Questions**:
1. How does semantic organization compare to traditional type-based organization in terms of user efficiency?
2. What is the user satisfaction level with AI-driven file grouping?
3. How accurately does the system detect cross-format project relationships?

### Methodology

#### Participants
- **Target**: 30-50 participants
- **Demographics**: 
  - Students, researchers, professionals who manage diverse file types
  - Mix of technical and non-technical backgrounds
  - Age range: 22-65
- **Recruitment**: University mailing lists, professional networks, online communities

#### Study Design
**Within-subjects design**: Each participant uses both traditional and semantic organization methods

#### Tasks

##### Task 1: File Organization Challenge
**Scenario**: Participants receive a dataset of 100-200 mixed files representing:
- Academic research project (papers, figures, data files, presentations)
- Music collection (songs, album art, lyrics, metadata)
- Work project (documents, images, spreadsheets, presentations)
- Personal photos (vacation, events, family)

**Conditions**:
1. **Traditional Method**: Organize using standard folder structure by file type
2. **Semantic Method**: Use Smart Semantic File Organizer with preview and modification capabilities

**Metrics**:
- Time to complete organization
- Number of files correctly grouped by project context
- User satisfaction ratings (1-5 scale)
- Number of modifications made to AI suggestions

##### Task 2: File Retrieval Test
**Scenario**: After organization, participants search for specific files in different contexts
- "Find the presentation slides for the marketing project"
- "Locate photos from the summer vacation"
- "Find data files related to the research analysis"

**Metrics**:
- Time to locate target files
- Success rate
- Number of clicks/folder traversals needed

##### Task 3: Preference Assessment
**Survey Questions**:
1. Which organization method felt more intuitive? (1-5 scale)
2. Which method would you prefer for your daily work? (Traditional/Semantic/No preference)
3. How accurate were the AI groupings? (1-5 scale)
4. How much time do you estimate this would save weekly? (Hours)
5. Would you recommend this system to colleagues? (Yes/No + explanation)

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Quantitative Measures
- **Efficiency**: Time to organize, time to retrieve
- **Accuracy**: Precision/recall of project detection vs. ground truth
- **User Behavior**: Click patterns, modification frequency
- **System Performance**: Processing time, confidence scores

#### Qualitative Measures
- **User Satisfaction**: Post-task interviews
- **Usability**: System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire
- **Trust**: Confidence in AI suggestions
- **Preference**: Comparative preference ratings

### Data Collection Protocol

#### Pre-Study
1. Demographic questionnaire
2. Current file organization habits survey
3. Technical proficiency assessment

#### During Study
1. Screen recording for interaction analysis
2. Think-aloud protocol during organization
3. Real-time satisfaction ratings
4. System logs and performance metrics

#### Post-Study
1. Comparative preference interview
2. System usability questionnaire
3. Suggestions for improvement
4. Willingness to adopt assessment

### Statistical Analysis Plan

#### Primary Analysis
- **Paired t-tests**: Compare efficiency metrics between conditions
- **Chi-square tests**: Analyze categorical preferences
- **Correlation analysis**: Relationship between user characteristics and performance

#### Secondary Analysis
- **Regression analysis**: Factors predicting user satisfaction
- **Cluster analysis**: User behavior patterns
- **Thematic analysis**: Qualitative feedback categorization

### Expected Outcomes

#### Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Semantic organization will result in higher user satisfaction than traditional methods
2. **H2**: File retrieval will be faster with semantic organization
3. **H3**: Users will prefer semantic organization for mixed-content projects
4. **H4**: Technical proficiency will not significantly impact preference

#### Success Criteria
- **Significant improvement** in at least 2 primary metrics
- **User satisfaction score** > 4.0/5.0 for semantic method
- **Preference rate** > 60% for semantic over traditional
- **Accuracy** > 80% for cross-format project detection

3. **Figure 1**: Time efficiency comparison (box plots)
4. **Figure 2**: User satisfaction ratings (bar charts)
5. **Figure 3**: Preference distribution by user type

#### Key Quotes for Paper
- User testimonials about semantic grouping accuracy
- Insights about cross-format file relationships
- Suggestions for system improvements
- Adoption barriers and facilitators

### Ethical Considerations
- **IRB Approval**: Required before data collection
- **Informed Consent**: Clear explanation of study purpose and data use
- **Privacy**: Anonymization of all personal file content
- **Voluntary Participation**: Right to withdraw at any time
- **Data Security**: Encrypted storage and secure transmission

### Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: IRB submission and participant recruitment
- **Week 3-6**: Data collection (10-15 participants per week)
- **Week 7-8**: Data analysis and statistical testing
- **Week 9-10**: Qualitative analysis and report writing

### Budget Considerations
- **Participant Compensation**: $25 per participant × 40 participants = $1,000
- **Software Licenses**: Statistical analysis software
- **Equipment**: Recording software, survey tools
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $1,500-2,000

This user study protocol provides rigorous empirical validation for the academic paper and demonstrates real-world effectiveness of the Smart Semantic File Organizer.
